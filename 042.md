# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary

Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

The MeritNFT will be minted to `msg.sender` through the `function mint(uint256 amount) external payable {` of _MeritDutchAuction.sol_ then calling the `function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {`of _MeritNFT.sol_

However, if `msg.sender` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

*"A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers."*

Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
 *
 * WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
 *
 * Requirements:
 *
 * - `tokenId` must not exist.
 * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
 *
 * Emits a {Transfer} event.
 */
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
```

## Impact

Users possibly lose their NFTs

## Code Snippet
[MeritNFT.sol#L58-L63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritNFT.sol#L58-L63)
```solidity
    /// @notice Mints an NFT. Can only be called by an address with the minter role and tokenId must be unique
    /// @param _tokenId Id of the token
    /// @param _receiver Address receiving the NFT
    function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {
        _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
