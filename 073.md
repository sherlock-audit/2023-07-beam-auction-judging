# Users can `mint()` NFTs for the the lowest price possible (endPrice)

## Summary

The constructor doesn't force the start time to be before block.timestamp meaning a person can accidentally(or intentionally) create an auction with a block.timestamp in the past. This would cause the mint function to revert when attempting to calculate the timePassed or even worse allow users to mint NFTs for a lower price than the startPrice by fast forwarding timePassed [code here.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L116)

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        uint256 timePassed = time - startTime;
        uint256 totalSteps = (endTime - startTime) / stepSize;
        uint256 currentStep = timePassed / stepSize;
        uint256 priceRange = startPrice - endPrice;

        // Calculate the price at the current step
        uint256 price = startPrice - (priceRange * currentStep / totalSteps);
        return price;
```
## Impact

Let's say the contract was just deployed and the startTime was set to exactly 7 days ago.

timePassed = Today - startTime(1 week ago) = 7 days
totalSteps = 7 (step size 1 day)
currentStep = 7 days / 1 day = 7 or the last step
priceRange = 100 - 1 = 99

price = 100 - (99 * 7 / 7) = 1

This would allow the user to then purchase the NFT for the lowest price possible. Essentially giving them a huge discount and causing a loss to the protocol.

## Code Snippet

Below is the code that uses the getPrice() function in order to price NFTs based on the current step.

```solidity
        uint256 pricePaid = getPrice();
        // Total price being paid is the current price times the amount of NFTs
        uint256 totalPaid = pricePaid * amount;
        // Auction must have started
        require(block.timestamp >= startTime, "Auction not started");
        // Cannot mint more than the mint cap
        require(mintedBefore + amount <= MINT_CAP, "Mint cap reached");
        // Cannot mint more than the cap per address
        require(mintedPerAddressBefore + amount <= CAP_PER_ADDRESS, "Mint cap per address reached");
        // Make sure enough ETH was sent in the transaction
        require(msg.value >= totalPaid, "Insufficient funds");

```

You can see in the mint function that the user is required to send more ether than the total amount they've spent (`totalPaid`) so far. However `totalPaid` is being calculated by taking the amount of NFTs the user wants to mint and multiplying it by the return value of `getPrice()` which in this case would be the `endPrice` since the `startTime` was set in the past before the current block.timestamp.
 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the constructor add a require statement that forces the user to pass a startTime that is after the block.timestamp.

```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
```
