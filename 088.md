# Missing input validation on constructor function parameters can lead to loss of value

## Summary
Missing input validation on constructor function parameters can lead to loss of value

## Vulnerability Detail
There are some problems with the input validation in constructor（）, more specifically related to the timestamp values.
endTime_ can be much further in the future than startTime_, so  the auction may never end
Both endTime_ and startTime_ can be much further in the future, so auction might never start.

## Impact
Missing parameter validation, the auction may never end and the auction may never start

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L68-L87
    constructor(
        uint256 startPrice_,
        uint256 endPrice_,
        uint256 startTime_,
        uint256 endTime_,
        uint256 stepSize_
    ) { 
        // Cannot have 0 second steps
        require(stepSize_ > 0, "Step size must be greater than 0");
        // Duration must be a multiple of step size
        require((endTime_ - startTime_) % stepSize_ == 0, "Step size must be multiple of total duration");
        // Start price must be greater than end price
        require(startPrice_ > endPrice_, "Start price must be greater than end price");

        startPrice = startPrice_;
        endPrice = endPrice_;
        startTime = startTime_;
        endTime = endTime_;
        stepSize = stepSize_;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a minimal duration value, for example 1 day, as well as a max value, for example 20 days. Make sure auction does not start more than X days after it has been created as well.
