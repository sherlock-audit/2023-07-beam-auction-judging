# MeritDutchAuction.sol doesn't have timestamp protection

## Summary
MeritDutchAuction's mint does not have timestamp protection.

## Vulnerability Detail
The MeritDutchAuction calculates the price of minting by using the current block timestamp as `getPriceAt(time)` during and after the auction. But an user might be interested to mint only during a brief time interval or before the auction has ended.

## Impact
The user is unable to control its transaction and it might be interest to mint only in a time interval or before auction ending
