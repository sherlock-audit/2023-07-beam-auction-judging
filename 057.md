# NFTs are mintable after Auction deadline expires

## Summary
NFTs are mintable after Auction deadline expires

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In MeritDutchAuction.sol contract, mint() function,

```Solidity
File: dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol

128    function mint(uint256 amount) external payable {

        // Checks
        // Cache mintedBefore to save on sloads
        uint256 mintedBefore = minted;
        // Cache mintedPerAddressBefore to save on sloads
        uint256 mintedPerAddressBefore = mintedPerAddress[msg.sender];
        // Price being paid is the current price
        uint256 pricePaid = getPrice();
        // Total price being paid is the current price times the amount of NFTs
        uint256 totalPaid = pricePaid * amount;
        // Auction must have started
        require(block.timestamp >= startTime, "Auction not started");
        // Cannot mint more than the mint cap
        require(mintedBefore + amount <= MINT_CAP, "Mint cap reached");
        // Cannot mint more than the cap per address
        require(mintedPerAddressBefore + amount <= CAP_PER_ADDRESS, "Mint cap per address reached");
        // Make sure enough ETH was sent in the transaction
        require(msg.value >= totalPaid, "Insufficient funds");



        // Some code



169 }
```


The mint() function does not validate if the Auction is still running or ended, Therefore it is  allowing a NFT minting to be made after the Auction end time. The endtime variable is used to store the end date of the auction and it is not used in mint() to validate whether the NFTs minting is being made within the deadline.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/ab734b575dc3b268de0457c2e3ab0e7d10cd7dd8/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L128-L146

**POC:**
Add this test in test/MeritDutchAuction.t

```Solidity

    function testMintAfterAuctionEnd() public {
        vm.startPrank(wallet1);
        uint256 balanceBefore = wallet1.balance;
>>      vm.warp(endTime + 1 days);
        auction.mint{value: START_PRICE}(1);
        uint256 balanceAfter = wallet1.balance;

        assertEq(auction.minted(), 1);
        assertEq(auction.totalRaised(), END_PRICE);
        assertEq(address(auction).balance, END_PRICE);
        assertEq(auction.mintedPerAddress(wallet1), 1);
        assertEq(nft.ownerOf(1), wallet1);
        assertEq(balanceBefore - balanceAfter, END_PRICE);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
In above test, i tested with endTime + 1 days  and the test should have been failed since the once Auction is ended minting is not allowed in auctions but the test is passed with below result.

**Result:**
```Solidity
[PASS] testMintAfterAuctionEnd() (gas: 229897)
```
