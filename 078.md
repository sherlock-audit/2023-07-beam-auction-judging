# Use `safeMint()` instead of `_mint()`

## Summary

Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

Vulnerability Detail
The msg.sender will be minted as a proof of staking NFT when _stakeToken() is called.

However, if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285

## Impact

Users possibly lose their NFTs

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /// @notice Mints an NFT. Can only be called by an address with the minter role and tokenId must be unique
    /// @param _tokenId Id of the token
    /// @param _receiver Address receiving the NFT
    function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {
        _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `safeMint` instead of mint to check received address support for `ERC721` implementation.
