# Storage and Gas Report

## Summary
Storage and Gas Report
## Details
Storage and Gas can be save at MeritDutchAuction.sol by using more efficient uint declarations e.g from line Line 11 -24, variables CAP_PER_ADDRESS, MINT_CAP can use uint16 since they are constant and startTime,endTime can also use uint64 right next to the previous variables. This changes can also be made on other parts of the code where this variables are declared or used to save storage and gas.
