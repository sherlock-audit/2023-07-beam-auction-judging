# Ownable is used, but owner is not initialized

## Summary
We can see that [MeritDutchAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L9) is using  Open-zeppelin `Ownable`, but it is [not initializing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L68-L87) it.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Ownable` now requires the contract to specifically give it's address to initialize the owner.
[Ownable.sol/L38-L40](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L38-L40)
```jsx
    constructor(address initialOwner) {
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
```
Thus if the owner is not initialized it may lead to contract not being able to operate in fully. Example is [`claimProceeds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L172C1-L179) function, as it's has a modifier `onlyOwner()`. 
```jsx
    function claimProceeds() external onlyOwner {
        // Send ETH to the owner
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}(bytes(""));
        // Revert if transfer failed
        require(success, "Claim failed");
        // Emit event for offchain integrations
        emit ClaimedProceeds(address(this).balance);
    }
```
## Impact
`Ownable` is not initialized it could lead to contract malfunctioning, or some parameters being hard-coded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call the [`Ownable.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L38-L40) constructor and set the owner
```jsx
    constructor(
        uint256 startPrice_,
        uint256 endPrice_,
        uint256 startTime_,
        uint256 endTime_,
        uint256 stepSize_
    ) Ownable(msg.sender) {
    ...     
```
