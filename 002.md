# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721


## Vulnerability Detail
The msg.sender will be minted when mint() is called.
However, if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.



As per the documentation of EIP-721:

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285
