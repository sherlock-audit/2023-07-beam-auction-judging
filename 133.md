# Use safeMint instead of mint


medium
## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail
The msg.sender will be minted a NFT when 'mint() is called.
However, if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.
As per the documentation of EIP-721:

A wallet/broker application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.
Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

## Impact
Users NFT would be frozen hence they loose their NFTs
