# Event `ClaimedProceeds` will always be emitted with zero balance

## Summary
Event `ClaimedProceeds` will always be emitted with zero balance

## Vulnerability Detail
In `claimProceeds` function of `MeritDutchAuction.sol`, an event `ClaimedProceeds` is emitted with the contract's balance.
However, it is emitted after all balance is sent to the owner, so it will be always zero.

## Impact
The comment above event says it is used for off-chain integration, so the off-chain integration will be broken totally.

## Recommendation
Emit the event before sending ETH to the owner, or use a variable to store it and use it.
