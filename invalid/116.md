# `MeritDutchAuction.sol` never initialized the `owner` for `Ownable.sol`

## Summary
OZ's Ownable.sol now requires the owner to be explicitly set rather than assuming msg.sender as before. Since the contract never calls the Ownable.sol constructor _owner is never set and is left as address(0). 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner) {
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
```
## Impact
Important functions protected by the onlyOwner() modifier become completely nonfunctional Example;
