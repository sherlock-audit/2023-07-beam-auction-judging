### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Do not use deprecated `_setupRole` library functions
The function [_setupRole is deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.2/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol#L204-#L208) in favor of `_grantRole` function. The function may currently work, but if a bug is found in this version of OpenZeppelin, and the version that you're forced to upgrade to no longer has this function, you'll encounter unnecessary delays in porting and testing replacement contracts.

### <a name="L-3"></a>[L-3] Solidity version 0.8.20 may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new PUSH0 op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an [earlier EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) version

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] Cache the length of the array to avoid repeated computation thus saving gas (per iteration).
When the length of an array is read in each iteration of the loop using the .length property, it  triggers an SLOAD (storage read) operation. This can be expensive in terms of gas, especially if the array is large or the function is called many times. Additionally, the loop also increments the loop variable in each iteration, which is unnecessary.
If the length of the array is stored in a local variable before the loop starts, it reduces the number of SLOAD operations to just one. This improves the performance of the function and reduces the gas cost. Additionally, the loop variable is incremented only once per iteration, making the loop more efficient.

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage.
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

### <a name="GAS-3"></a>[GAS-3] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated.
Mark data types as `calldata` instead of `memory` where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as `calldata`. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies `memory` storage.

### <a name="GAS-5"></a>[GAS-5] Use custom errors instead of revert strings for gas savings.
Starting from Solidity version 0.8.4, there is a convenient and gas efficient way to explain why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. The require and revert strings are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deployment and runtime cost.
Custom errors are defined using the error statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts, including interfaces and libraries. [Reference](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)

### <a name="GAS-6"></a>[GAS-6] Don't initialize variables with default value.
If the variable is not initialized, it is assumed to have a default value. For example, 0 for a uint variable and false for a boolean variable. When we explicitly initialize it with its default value, we are simply wasting gas.

### <a name="GAS-7"></a>[GAS-7] Pre-increments and pre-decrements are cheaper than post-increments and post-decrements.
The majority of Solidity loops increment a uint256 variable that starts at 0. These increment operations never need to be checked for overflow or underflow because they will run out of gas, thus never reaching the max number of the uint256 value.
The operation has the tendency to save a decent amount of gas (30-40 gas) per loop iteration. However, for a lengthy loop, this value can be very significant.

### <a name="GAS-8"></a>[GAS-8] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`.
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

### <a name="GAS-9"></a>[GAS-9] Constructor can be marked as payable to save gas.
When a constructor is marked as payable, it means that it can receive Ether during contract deployment. By default, constructors are not payable, meaning they cannot receive any Ether.
When a constructor is not marked as payable, the Solidity compiler automatically generates a value check to ensure that no Ether is sent during deployment. This value check adds some bytecode and incurs gas costs during deployment.
However, when you mark the constructor as payable, the value check is not generated, and therefore, the associated gas costs are eliminated. This can result in some gas savings during contract deployment. It is important to note that marking the constructor as payable should only be done if you explicitly want to receive Ether during deployment and have a specific use case for it.

### <a name="GAS-10"></a>[GAS-10] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas.
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

```

### <a name="GAS-11"></a>[GAS-11] Use shorter revert strings. Also, use custom errors instead of revert strings for gas savings.
In Solidity, a string is a dynamic array of bytes. When a string is stored in memory, it is split into 32-byte-sized chunks, also known as "words," to make it easier for the Solidity compiler to work with. Each word can hold up to 32 bytes of data.
When a require statement fails, it causes the entire transaction to revert, which means that all the gas used by the transaction up to that point is lost. This includes the gas that was used to run the require statement and any other code in the transaction.
Using shorter revert strings reduces the amount of gas consumed by require statements, which can help reduce the cost of transactions for users. Shorter strings also help keep the bytecode size of the smart contract smaller, which can help reduce deployment costs and improve overall contract performance.
That being said, it is still important to provide enough context in the revert string to help users understand why the require statement failed. A good balance is to use short, descriptive error messages that convey the reason for the failure without being unnecessarily verbose. It is also a good practice to use error codes in the revert strings to help with automated error handling and debugging.
If smart contract supports Solidity 0.8.4 or higher, we might also consider using custom errors. Custom errors are cheaper (in terms of deployment and runtime cost) than revert strings when the revert statements are met.

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
