# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary

Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: MeritNFT.sol

  function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {
      _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
  }

```
[Link to Code]()

When minting an NFT, if `receiver` is a contract address that does not support `ERC721`, the NFT can be frozen in the contract forever.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

>A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

As per the documentaÅ›tion of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

> Usage of _mint method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L263

Also, while reviewing `mint` function of `MeritDutchAuction`, the CEI Pattern is successfully implemented to tackle any kind of reentrancy vulnerability which may arise because of using `_safeMint`. So it is perfectly fine to use `safeMint` there in `mint` function of `MeritNFT` to avoid potential loss of buyer's NFT.

## Impact

Buyer possibly lose their NFTs

## Code Snippet

Shown Above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `safeMint` instead of `mint` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
