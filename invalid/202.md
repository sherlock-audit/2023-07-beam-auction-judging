# use _safeMint() instead of _mint()

## Summary
Some nft's might be lost

## Vulnerability Detail
`_mint` doesn't check if the receiving address can transfer/interact with nfts after they are received. This might 
lead to some nfts getting stuck after they are minted. Implementing `_safeMint` however, should be done with caution since it introduces the `_checkOnERC721Received` hook that can lead to reentrancy attack possibilites. 
## Impact
Some nft's might be lost/stuck

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() or alternatively limit the addresses that can mint to only EOAs.
