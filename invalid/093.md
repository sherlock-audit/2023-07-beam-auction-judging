# Hacked owner or malicious owner can immediately steal all assets on the platform

## Summary
The owner is a single point of failure and a centralization risk

## Vulnerability Detail
Having a single EOA as the only owner of contracts is a large centralization risk and a single point of failure. A single private key may be taken in a hack, or the sole holder of the key may become unable to retrieve the key when necessary. Consider changing to a multi-signature setup, or having a role-based authorization model.



## Impact
 A single private key may be taken in a hack, or the sole holder of the key may become unable to retrieve the key when necessary.


## Code Snippet


```solidity
 function setNFT(address nft_) external onlyOwner {
        // Can only be set once
        require(address(nft) == address(0), "NFT already set");
        // NFT contract must allow this contract to mint NFTs
        nft = MeritNFT(nft_);
    }
```




```solidity
function claimProceeds() external onlyOwner {
        // Send ETH to the owner
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}(bytes(""));
        // Revert if transfer failed
        require(success, "Claim failed");
        // Emit event for offchain integrations
        emit ClaimedProceeds(address(this).balance);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a timelock, to give users enough time to withdraw their approvals before some malicious action becomes possible.
