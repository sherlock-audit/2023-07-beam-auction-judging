# MeritDutchAuction::claimProceeds emit incorrect event

## Summary
MeritDutchAuction::claimProceeds emit incorrect event which has zero for balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function claimProceeds() external onlyOwner {
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}(bytes(""));
        require(success, "Claim failed");
        emit ClaimedProceeds(address(this).balance);
    }
```
Since the funds have been already transferred, `address(this).balance` in the `ClaimedProceeds` will be always 0.

## Impact
If the event is used off-chain for important operations, it will cause damage to protocol.
