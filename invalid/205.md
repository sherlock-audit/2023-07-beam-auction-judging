# Huge Number of Calls inside for loops that may address DoS

medium
## Summary
Huge Number of Calls inside for loops that may address DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
when a user wants to mint 10000 NFTS at that time mint function is called so during that time a for loop runs iterarting till 10000 so it could lead to Dos if one of the mint calls reverts or execution runs out of gas


## Impact
Calls to external contracts inside a loop are dangerous (especially if the loop index can be user-controlled) because it could lead to DoS if one of the calls reverts or execution runs out of gas.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Avoid combining multiple calls in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop
Always assume that external calls can fail
