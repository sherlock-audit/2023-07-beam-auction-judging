# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary

Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

When users pays the auction price Merit NFT will be minted to msg.sender. However, if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

Openzeppelin also discourages the use of `_mint()` whenever possible.

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285

```solidity

    /**
     * @dev Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
     *
     * WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must not exist.
     * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {

```

## Impact

User can possibly permanently lock their NFT.

## Code Snippet

[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritNFT.sol#L61-L63)

```solidity
    function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {
        _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use ` _safeMint()` instead of `mint()`  to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.

` MeritDutchAuction` is the only address that can mint MeritNFT. `mint()` function in `MeritDutchAuction` follows checks -> effects ->interactions patterns. As far as I can see re-entrance attack is not possible here and hence re-entrance guard is not required.
