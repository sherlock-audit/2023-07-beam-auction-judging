# Use _safemint instead of _mint

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail
The msg.sender will be minted the NFT NFT when `MeritDutchAuction::mint()` is called.

However, if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285

## Impact
Users possibly lose their NFTs

        _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
