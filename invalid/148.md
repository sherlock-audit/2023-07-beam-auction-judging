# Contracts never initialize owner for Ownable.sol

## Summary
OZ's `Ownable.sol` now requires the owner to be explicitly set rather than assuming msg.sender as before. Since the contracts never call the `Ownable.sol` constructor _owner is never set and is left as address(0). This makes MeritDutchAuction.sol completely nonfunctional and disables all owner realated functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Following OZ version is found in the package.jason

```solidity
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.9.2"
  }
}
```

But, when we look at the OZ latest ownable, the constructor takes input argument which is set as owner.

The Ownable.sol (inherited by Ownable2Step.sol) constructor now requires the owner to be explicitly set rather than always defaulting to msg.sender.

## Impact

Non function of `onlyOwner` modifier protection.

## Recommendation
Call the Ownable.sol constructor to set the owner
