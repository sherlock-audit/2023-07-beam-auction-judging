# NFT can be stuck in user's contract forever

## Summary

OpenZeppelin ERC721 `_mint()` is used for minting. If the user uses a contract instead of EOA and the contract does not support NFT transfer, the NFT bought in the auction can be stuck in the contract forever. Use OpenZeppelin ERC721 `_safeMint()` instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MeritDutchAuction.mint()` calls `MeritNFT.mint()`, which calls OpenZeppelin ERC721 `_mint()`:

OpenZeppelin ERC721 `_mint()` does not verify if the receiver can handle NFT. If the user uses a contract for the auction and the contract can't transfer NFT, that NFT can be stuck in the contract forever.

## Impact

NFT can be stuck in user's contract forever.
