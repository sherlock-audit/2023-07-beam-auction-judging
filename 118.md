# Lack of validation in the mint function assumes that MeritDutchAuction.sol#mint has passed for every iteration.

## Summary

The smart contract, MeritDutchAuction, lacks proper validation for NFT minting, which can lead to an inconsistent state if the minting process fails for any reason. This vulnerability could result in incorrect incrementation of the ```minted``` and ```mintedPerAddress``` variables, leading to an inconsistent state. A potential attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the minting process and disrupt the integrity of the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract does not handle potential failures during the minting process, assuming that the NFT minting operation always succeeds. As a result, if the underlying NFT contract's ```mint``` function fails or throws an exception, it can lead to incorrect incrementation of minting-related variables, without minting the actual NFTs. This inconsistency can result in a misleading state of the contract and affect the fairness of the auction.

## Impact

If the minting process fails during execution, the contract's state becomes inconsistent, where the ```minted``` and ```mintedPerAddress``` variables are incremented without successfully minting the corresponding NFTs. This vulnerability can undermine the integrity of the auction and potentially enable attackers to exploit the inconsistent state for their advantage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding a try-catch system in order to ensure that the external call was successful or not and revert the whole transaction if not. 

```
function mint(uint256 amount) external payable {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Interactions
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
        try nft.mint(mintedBefore + i + 1, msg.sender) {
            // Minting successful, proceed to the next iteration
        } catch {
            // Minting failed, revert the transaction
            revert("NFT minting failed");
        }
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
```
