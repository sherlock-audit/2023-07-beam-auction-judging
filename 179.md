# Uninitialized owner can lead to owner being address(0)

## Summary
Uninitialized owner can lead to owner being address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail
OZ's ''Ownable" now requires explicitly to set the owner of the contract in the constructor

constructor(address initialOwner) {
     _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
 }

Ownable now doesn't automatically set the owner to the address that deployed the contract.

## Impact
Owner can be address(0) making the functions which use the onlyOwner modifier useless,
