# MeritNFT mints tokens using ERC20 _mint instead of _safeMint.

## Summary

MeritNFT mints tokens using ERC20 _mint instead of _safeMint.

## Vulnerability Detail

Use of _mint means tokens purchased and minted by a smart contracts are not checked to have correctly implemented ERC721Receiver.

## Impact

Merit NFTs could potentially be lost forever in poorly written contracts which mint from the auction but are unable to manage or transfer NFTs. These tokens would be permanently removed from circulation which could hinder the token ecosystem.
