# Wrong emit value

## Summary
Wrong emit value

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function claimProceeds() external onlyOwner {
        // Send ETH to the owner
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}(bytes(""));
        // Revert if transfer failed
        require(success, "Claim failed");
        // Emit event for offchain integrations
        emit ClaimedProceeds(address(this).balance);
    }
``` 
This will always emit 0 as balance has been transferred to owner

## Impact
Wrong information on frontend or any service making use of it

cache the balance of the contract to to a varible and emit it.
