# [M1] A Clever Miner can have unfair advantage and cause Financial loss to the platform through block timestamp manipulation

## Summary
The Auction Merit contract is vulnerable to block timestamp manipulation, which can be exploited to gain an unfair advantage and undermine the integrity of the auction process. The vulnerability allows the minter to manipulate the block timestamp to perform actions that deviate from the intended behavior of the contract.

### Scenarios
**Early/Late Minting**: The minter can manipulate the block timestamp to mint NFTs before the actual auction start time or after the auction time. By setting the block timestamp to a time in the future, the minter can bypass the auction restrictions and mint NFTs prematurely, giving them an unfair advantage over other participants.

**Undervalued Payment**: The minter can manipulate the block timestamp to pay for NFTs at the initial start price, even if the actual time is close to the end price. By setting the block timestamp to an earlier time, the minter can exploit the lower start price, resulting in an undervalued payment for the NFTs they acquire.

### Impact
The manipulation of the block timestamp in the AuctionMerit contract can have the following consequences:

**Unfair Advantage**: The minter can gain an unfair advantage over other participants by minting NFTs before the auction starts or paying at a lower price, distorting the fairness of the auction process.

**Financial Loss**: Legitimate participants may suffer financial losses due to undervalued payments made by the minter, as the NFTs are acquired at a lower price than intended.

```solidity

    /// @notice Returns the current price
    function getPrice() public view returns(uint256) {
        // Use the current timestamp to get the current price
->        return getPriceAt(block.timestamp);
    }

    /// @notice Returns the price at a given time
    /// @param time Timestamp
    function getPriceAt(uint256 time) public view returns(uint256) {
        // If auction hasn't started yet, return start price
        if(time < startTime) {
            return startPrice;
        }
        // If auction has ended, return end price
        if(time >= endTime) {
            return endPrice;
        }

...
    }
