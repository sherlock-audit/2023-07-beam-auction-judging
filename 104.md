# Use safeMint() instead of mint

## Summary
The MeritNFT.sol contract uses the _mint function to mint NFTs, instead of the _safeMint function. This could lead to a loss, as the _mint function does not check whether the recipient address is able to receive ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
_mint() is discouraged in favor of _safeMint() which ensures that the recipient is either an EOA or implements IERC721Receiver. The _mint function does not check whether the recipient address is able to receive ERC721 tokens. It can lead to NFT being locked in the user’s contract.

## Impact
If a user mints an NFT to an address that is unable to receive ERC721 tokens, the NFT will be locked and non-transferable. This could lead to financial loss for the user, as they would be unable to sell or trade the NFT.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritNFT.sol#L61

```solidity
function mint(uint256 _tokenId, address _receiver) external onlyMinter {
        _mint(_receiver, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `_safeMint` function is a more secure way to mint NFTs, as it checks whether the recipient address is able to receive ERC721 tokens. The `_safeMint` function is available in both the OpenZeppelin and Solmate libraries.

- Use the `_safeMint` function instead of the `_mint` function.
- **Ensure that the mint function is treated as an interaction, rather than an effect.**
- **Consider adding a reentrancy guard to the mint function.**
