# The maximum amount of NFTs that can be minted per address can be easily bypassed

## Summary
Every user can bypass this minting limit by deploying multiple contracts and each of them would mint tokens within the mentioned threshold in a single transaction. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows users to mint only 4 NFTs per address. However, users can bypass this limitation by writing a contract that deploys multiple contracts, with capable of minting 4 tokens and sending them to arbitrary addresses in a single transaction.
It should be noted that users can still bypass this limit by creating multiple EAOs.

        require(mintedPerAddressBefore + amount <= CAP_PER_ADDRESS, "Mint cap per address reached");
```
## Tool used
