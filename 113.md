# CAP_PER_ADDRESS doesn't provide real protection

## Summary

In MeritDutchAuction, there is a variable that defines how many NFTs can one address owns. However, this can be easily bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail

As there are many people who have multiple addresses, the problem with bypassing this restriction arises. It doesn't create any real protection and that's not a good practice to restrict the number of NFTs that can be minted by one address. This will basically lead to the situation where only few people minted almost all NFTs.

## Impact

CAP_PER_ADDRESS can be bypassed and few address can mint all NFTs.
