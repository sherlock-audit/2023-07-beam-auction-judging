# Use safeMint instead mint

## Summary
Use _safeMint instead _mint
## Vulnerability Detail
if msg.sender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.
As per the documentation of EIP-721:
A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.
Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin
Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L274-L285
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
 *
 * WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
 *
 * Requirements:
 *
 * - `tokenId` must not exist.
 * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
 *
 * Emits a {Transfer} event.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() instead of _mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
