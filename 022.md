# MeritNFT may be permanently locked when mint it to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

## Summary

Users may auction NFT by contract,  when MeritDutchAuction invoke _mint, which will  mint the NFT for the contract. If such contract is not support NFT transfer may result in the NFT being permanently locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

The auction process in question is as follows:
1. User creates contract to auction 4 NFTs
2. The protocol mints NFTs to the contract rather than to the user
3. The contract may not implement the NFT methods, resulting in tokens are permanently locked

## Impact

MeritNFT may be permanently locked when mint it to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Use _safeMint to ensure that the contract supports NFTs related methods
2. The mint method allows the user to pass in a specified receiver
