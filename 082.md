# Multiple auctions would conflict with each other

## Summary

If there are multiple auctions they would conflict with each other and any auction that isn't the first one would always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem lies inside the `MeritDutchAuction#mint()` function. when minting someone's NFT it uses the `mintedBefore` variable to calculate the new NFT's Id. This will make issues if there are multiple auctions as the second auction would try to mint an NFT that's already minted before by the first auction.

### Proof of Concept

- There are two auctions for the same NFT **AuctionA** and **AuctionB**
- **AuctionA** has 54 minted NFTs & **AuctionB** has 0 minted NFTs
- When Bob tries to buy an NFT from **AuctionB** the auction tries to mint an NFT with id 1 but it would always revert as NFT with id 1 is already minted by Alice from **AuctionA**

## Impact

Any auction using the same NFT that isn't the first one would always revert inside `mint()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `nft.totalSupply()` instead of `mintedBefore` to generate the NFT ids to resolve conflict.
